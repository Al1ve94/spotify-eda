EDA for Machine Learning, Honors Assignment.

IBM's professional course on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Machine Learning provides an opportunity to analyze a dataset of personal interest. This homework / project is created to apply tools and techniques acquired in the course using Spotify dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs/).

The primary goal is to practice EDA skills, excercise in testing forming and testing hypotheses using various tools using Jupyter Notebook and communicate any findings.
